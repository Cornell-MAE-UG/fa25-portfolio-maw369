## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/cornellid-photo.png" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is {{ site.name }}, and I am I am passionate about engineering systems that push the boundaries of what machines can do in challenging environments. As a Mechanical Engineering student at Cornell, I have developed a strong foundation in dynamics, thermodynamics, system design, and fluid mechanics, while applying these principles directly through hands-on research in the Collective Embodied Intelligence Lab. My work designing and prototyping autonomous, terrain-modifying robots has strengthened my skills in CAD, 3D printing, mechanical architecture, and embedded sensing—while fueling my fascination with resilient robotic systems capable of operating independently in unpredictable conditions. Alongside my R&D internship experience at ITT Goulds Pumps, where I optimized components and collaborated across engineering teams, I have grown into an engineer who thrives at the intersection of mechanical design, autonomous behavior, and real-world problem solving. I am driven to continue building robotic and aerospace systems that can explore, adapt, and operate where humans cannot, contributing to safer, smarter, and more capable technologies for the future.
