This project develops a digitally-instrumented torque wrench using finite-element analysis to determine strain distribution under load and to identify an optimal strain-gauge placement. ANSYS Static Structural was used to model the wrench geometry, apply realistic boundary conditions, and evaluate normal strain, principal stress, and total deformation for a 600 in-lbf input torque.

Material selection was performed using published mechanical properties and safety-factor requirements, and several geometry modifications were evaluated to improve strain sensitivity while remaining below allowable stress limits. The final design integrates a bonded strain gauge configured as a half-bridge, enabling electrical output prediction (mV/V) based on FEM strain values.
