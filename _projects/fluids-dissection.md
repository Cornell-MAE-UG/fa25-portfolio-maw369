As part of a hands-on fluid mechanics class, MAE 3230, we did a group project to dissect fluid machines. My team performed a complete dissection of a 4-stroke V-twin engine to gain a deeper mechanical understanding of how its internal components interact to convert chemical energy into mechanical output. Using power tools and proper teardown procedures, we systematically disassembled the engine—removing the camshaft, pistons, crankcase, valves, timing components, and ancillary systems.

Throughout the process, we examined the geometry and function of each part, identifying how fluid flow, combustion, lubrication, and pressure changes drive the engine’s performance across all four strokes. This dissection allowed us to connect theoretical concepts from class to the physical mechanisms inside a real engine, reinforcing our understanding of airflow, fuel delivery, compression, and exhaust processes.

After completing the teardown, we created a detailed video walkthrough summarizing what we learned, highlighting the function of each major component, and reflecting on how fluid dynamics principles apply to internal combustion engines.
