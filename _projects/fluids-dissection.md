As part of a hands-on fluid mechanics course, MAE 3230, I worked in a team to dissect and analyze a 4-stroke V-twin internal combustion engine to better understand how fluid flow, combustion, and mechanical motion interact to produce power. Our group performed a full teardown of the engine using proper disassembly procedures, removing major components including the cylinder heads, crankcase, camshaft, pistons, valves, and other timing components.

My primary contribution focused on explaining the four-stroke cycle and linking it directly to the engine’s internal mechanisms. I walked through how each cylinder undergoes intake, compression, power, and exhaust strokes, emphasizing how pressure changes, airflow, and combustion drive piston motion. I also analyzed the mechanical timing relationship by examining the exposed crankshaft and camshaft gears. By counting gear teeth, I demonstrated the 2:1 crankshaft-to-camshaft rotation ratio, clarifying how the camshaft rotates once for every two crankshaft revolutions to ensure proper valve timing in a four-stroke engine.

I further explained the pushrod valve train, showing how camshaft lobes actuate lifters and pushrods, which then rotate rocker arms to open and close the intake and exhaust valves at precise moments in the cycle. In addition, I analyzed the flywheel and electric starter system, explaining how the flywheel’s outer gear teeth allow a small starter pinion to temporarily mesh and spin the crankshaft during engine startup until combustion becomes self-sustaining.

To connect the mechanical dissection to fluid mechanics theory, I helped to compare our calculated Reynolds number for airflow through the carburetor to validate our flow assumption and compared this with Reynolds numbers for water and highly viscous fluids such as maple syrup. This comparison demonstrated why turbulent-flow assumptions are appropriate for air–fuel mixtures in engines and reinforced how viscosity and density influence flow regimes.

Following the dissection, I helped create a technical video walkthrough presenting these findings, clearly connecting physical engine components to fluid dynamics principles such as turbulence, pressure differentials, and energy conversion. This project strengthened my ability to translate theoretical fluid mechanics concepts into real mechanical systems and communicate complex engineering ideas clearly and effectively.
