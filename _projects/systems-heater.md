For our MAE 3260 final group assignment, we studied how a thermostat regulates temperature inside a home. We built a full closed-loop model that included system dynamics, feedback, a basic PI controller, and disturbance rejection. The idea was to analyze a real-world everyday system, but also apply the concepts of modeling, block diagrams, ODE representation, and control design that we learned during the semester.

As a team, we broke the project into sections including system modeling (my part), controller design, Simulink implementation, and disturbance analysis. Once the model was set up, we simulated how the room temperature changes depending on heating commands and outside weather. We also explored controller choices and tested how a deadband prevents unnecessary oscillations. Overall, this project gave us experience building a real engineering system from scratch—starting with physics and ending with a working closed-loop control implementation. It also helped connect classroom concepts like thermal dynamics, state-space modeling, and feedback control to something practical and recognizable.

**My Role:** System modeling (ODE formulation, block diagrams, thermostat control logic)

**Highlights**
- Modeled system dynamics using ODEs and state space
- Implemented PI control and deadband logic in Simulink
- Analyzed disturbance effects (seasonal outdoor temperature)

**Key Takeaway:** I gained hands-on experience turning physical heater behavior into a working closed-loop control model.
